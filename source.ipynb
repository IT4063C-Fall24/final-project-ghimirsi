This will allow for a deeper understanding of how different demographic groups consume various cereal brands. Next, I will integrate the U.S. Census demographic data by matching identifiers like age group and income range to enrich the analysis of consumption patterns. Additionally, I will assess the influence of marketing efforts by correlating historical marketing expenditures with changes in consumption over time, providing insights into the factors driving cereal consumption trends across demographics.\n",

    "To address the project questions on cereal consumption trends, I will first prepare the data by loading and cleaning the datasets to ensure accuracy. Then, I will conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in cereal consumption and brand popularity across various demographics using visualizations like histograms and bar charts. Next, I will merge the cereal consumption data with the popularity data based on demographic attributes and integrate U.S. Census data for deeper analysis. I will perform statistical tests, including regression analysis, to determine significant relationships between demographic factors and cereal consumption, as well as assess the impact of marketing expenditures over time. Finally, I will create visual representations of the findings and summarize key insights to provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders in the food industry. This structured approach will effectively utilize the identified datasets to answer the project questions and yield valuable insights into cereal consumption trends."
