# Analyzing Consumer Trends in Cereal Consumption: A Demographic and Marketing Perspective
<!-- Edit the title above with your project title -->

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing factors influencing cereal consumption trends among different demographics in the United States. The primary objectives are to identify demographic influences on cereal consumption, evaluate variations in cereal brand popularity across demographic groups, and investigate the correlation between marketing expenditures and consumption trends. The analysis will utilize three data sources: a CSV dataset on cereal consumption patterns, a CSV dataset detailing cereal brand popularity, and U.S. Census demographic data from a database. Merging these datasets will provide insights into target markets and guide marketing strategies based on data-driven findings. The project aims to deliver actionable insights that benefit stakeholders in the food industry.

### Reflection
<!-- Edit the following section with your reflection -->

#### What went well?
The data preparation and merging process went smoothly, allowing for the successful integration of the datasets. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) provided clear insights into consumption patterns and helped identify key demographic influences. Visualizations effectively illustrated the findings, making the data easy to understand.

#### What did not go well?
Some initial challenges were encountered with missing values and discrepancies in demographic identifiers, which required additional time for cleaning and standardizing the datasets. Additionally, some statistical analyses were more complex than anticipated, leading to delays in interpreting the results.

#### What did you learn?
I learned the importance of thorough data cleaning and preparation before analysis, as it significantly impacts the quality of insights derived from the data. I also gained experience in merging datasets from different sources and conducting regression analysis to identify relationships between variables.

#### What would you do differently next time?
Next time, I would allocate more time for the data cleaning phase and create a more detailed plan for handling missing values and discrepancies in the datasets. I would also consider exploring additional data sources earlier in the project to enhance the analysis. Finally, I would document the analysis process more rigorously to streamline future projects and improve reproducibility.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.
